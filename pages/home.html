Creating websites shouldn't be a daunting task. Simple Website Framework emphasizes simplicity and functionality, offering you a hassle-free experience in website development.

### **Building Blocks of Simplicity**

We've meticulously crafted every aspect to reflect a clean and minimalistic style. The result? Websites that look sleek and professional without unnecessary clutter.

### **Streamlined Development Process**

Say goodbye to tedious setup tasks. With the Simple Website Framework, we've already laid out the groundwork for you. Consider it your solid foundation. Now, instead of wrestling with the complexities of coding, you can focus on unleashing your creativity.

### **Effortless Page Creation**

Creating pages and posts is a breeze. We've leveraged Markdown to simplify the process. Just place your Markdown files in the designated folders, and voilà—they automatically become linkable pages. Navigation options? Also Markdown-based, providing an intuitive way to structure your website.

### **Flexibility at Your Fingertips**

Our framework features an easy-to-understand templating system. Whether you're a novice developer or a seasoned pro, customizing your website is a breeze. Extend its functionality effortlessly, tailoring it to your unique vision.

### **12 Column Grid System for Easy Content Positioning**

Positioning content has never been simpler. Our 12-column grid system allows you to arrange elements with precision. Whether you're creating a landing page or a complex layout, our grid ensures optimal alignment every time.

### **Clone and Customize**

Kickstart your projects using our base theme. Developers can clone it and create their own themes, significantly reducing development time and effort. The possibilities are endless, allowing you to tailor your website exactly as you envision.

### **Built for Security**

Safety is paramount. By forgoing an integral built-in editor, we minimize the risk of penetration attacks. Our framework is hardened against security threats, ensuring peace of mind for you and your users[^1].

[^1]: There actually is an editor, but it is a php based file manager and editor that is kept separate from the site itself and it is completely optional.

### **SEO-Optimized**

Stay ahead in the digital landscape. Our SEO-ready framework—from optimized page structures to metadata management—is primed for maximum visibility and performance in search engine results.

### **Extend with Ease**

Enhance your website's functionality using our easy-to-use, extendable plugin system. Whether you're adding new features or integrating third-party plugins, our framework provides a seamless experience without compromising security or stability.

### **Editor for Your Convenience**

While an optional editor is available, it remains separate from the core framework. It serves primarily as a standalone tool, offering advanced editing and file management capabilities alongside your website. Rest assured, your files are secure.

### **Experience the Ease**

The Simple Website Framework is designed with you in mind—whether you're a hobbyist website owner or a novice developer. Enjoy a user-friendly experience that simplifies the website development process.
