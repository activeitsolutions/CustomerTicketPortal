Creating a new page for your website is a breeze. Simply craft a new `.md` file. When it's time to publish, slot it into the `pages` folder, or nest it within a subfolder if you prefer. Access your new page via `<domain name>/<folder>/<file name>`. Typically, pages reside in the root `Pages` folder, but the choice is yours.

Crafting a post follows the same straightforward process as creating a page. The only distinction is that posts are housed in the `pages/posts` subfolder.

Each page requires specific metadata:

```markdown
<!-- pagetitle: -->
<!-- pagelayout: -->
<!-- pagedate: -->
<!-- pageimage: --> 
<!-- pageexcerpt: -->
<!-- pagekeywords: -->
<!-- pageauthor: -->
<!-- pagetype: -->
```

1. **pagetitle:** The page title serves as the main header and browser tab title.
2. **pagelayout:** Determines the theme layout applied. Usually, this defaults to 'page,' but your theme may offer alternative layouts.
3. **pagedate:** Indicates the publication date, typically your own, although the system can use the file's timestamp if left blank.
4. **pageimage:** Associates an image with the page, crucial for search engine visibility and, if applicable, as a thumbnail in layouts. Ensure the image path matches the page type (`pages/images` for pages, `pages/posts/images` for posts).
5. **pageexcerpt:** Provides a concise 120-character summary, serving as a description or tagline.
6. **pagekeywords:** Comprise essential terms for search engine optimization.
7. **pageauthor:** Identifies the author for posts, appearing beneath the title.
8. **pagetype:** Categorizes the page for search engines. Here are the possible catigorizations: `website, article, blog, profile, video, music, book, product`.
