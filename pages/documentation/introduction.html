The motivation behind creating this framework stems from the proliferation of CMS systems like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and similar apps. However, a common issue with these platforms is their top-heavy nature. For instance, WordPress comprises around 2,500 files due to its amalgamation of various projects into a single product. While this approach has its merits, it often leads to complexity, making it challenging for both developers and end-users.

Through years of development experience, it has become evident that end-users frequently neglect website maintenance and updates, despite their best intentions. This neglect poses a frustration for developers who strive for their clients' website success but face the reality of eventual disrepair.

A significant pain point lies in the complexity introduced by feature-rich editors. While unavoidable to some extent, I have developed a system aimed at mitigating these challenges.

## End Users

The Skeleton Website Framework offers streamlined solutions for end-users. Creating new pages or blog posts is as straightforward as generating a Markdown file. Despite Markdown's initial intimidating aura, it proves remarkably simple, as demonstrated in the Markdown tutorial. This method ensures a gentle learning curve while facilitating the creation of professional-looking content.

Each Markdown file includes metadata at the top, represented by seven lines of HTML comment code. Users can input relevant information such as dates, author details, image links, and choose from various presentation layouts, making content management intuitive and efficient.

## Developers

For developers, the framework provides a customizable template structure located within the 'template' folder. The 'skeleton' template serves as a foundational blueprint, allowing developers ample control over customization. Familiarity with WordPress theme development aids in navigating these template files, which offer extensive documentation and styling cues.

The framework ensures code stability by segregating critical functions from the template files, minimizing the risk of inadvertent breaks. Configuration options are centralized within the 'config' folder, while additional plugins can be seamlessly integrated via the 'plugins' folder, with comprehensive documentation provided.

Exploring the 'index', 'config', 'header', and 'footer' files provides a holistic understanding of the framework's architecture and functionality.

## Conclusion

In essence, the Skeleton Website Framework empowers both end-users and developers with comprehensive control. While this overview scratches the surface, subsequent articles will delve deeper into its functionalities, offering a detailed exploration of its capabilities.
